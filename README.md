# doing-things | UniFires
Tracking my main activities and engagements at uniFires - Cardano X Polkadot stuff.

Context
Got quite engaged and committed of what we launched at UniFires as a group of Cardano & Polkadot Ambassadors and builders who started to form in late 2023 to initiate and facilitate active initiatives and collaborations across the both ecosystems.
